Modeling of rumor spreading on social networks
All the codes here are from my thesis titled "Modeling of Rumor Spreading on Social Networks". All the codes are for comparing new model with a baseline model based on two data sets from Twitter; Obama and Palin
In chapter 4 the hypothesis is that dissenting opinions affect the rumor spreading 
In chapter 5 the hypothese are that 1- number of followings affect the chance by which a node gets affected 2- passage of time decrease the impact level of rumor posts
In chapter 6 all three hypotheses from the previous chapters (chapter 4 + chapter 5) get into one model
In chapters 4 and 5 codes we see more than one code for each chapter, the reason for that is that in each code we changed the baseline a little bit
